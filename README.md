# Personalized Healthcare Recommendation System 🏥💡

A smart healthcare recommendation system that provides **personalized wellness and health advice** based on user input. Built using **Flask** and **Machine Learning**, the project aims to assist users with general health suggestions tailored to their needs—not medical prescriptions.

## 💡 How it Works

1. **User Inputs**: The user enters symptoms or basic health details.
2. **ML Prediction**: The model processes inputs and predicts a category (e.g., health condition group).
3. **Recommendation**: Based on the output, the app suggests basic actions or care advice (e.g., rest, hydration, visit nearby clinics, etc.).

⚠️ This system **does not provide any real medical or pharmaceutical advice**.
